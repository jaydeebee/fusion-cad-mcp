# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added: `list_materials` and `set_material`

Material names live in Fusion's installed libraries, not the API docs, so
`find_api` can say how to assign a material but not what "aluminum" is called.
`list_materials("alumin")` finds the names (`Aluminum`, `Aluminum 6061`, ...),
and `set_material("Aluminum 6061", body_name="Body1")` assigns one to a body or
component. Verified against a live Fusion. A library material can be assigned
directly, and setting a component's material also overwrites its bodies'.

### Fixed: corpus crawl missed the User Manual and wasted ~1,500 requests on 404s

Most User Manual pages (`Events_UM`, `Units_UM`, `PythonSpecific_UM`, ...) and
`SampleList.htm` are linked only from the help site's table of contents, so the
crawl never reached them. It now seeds from `toctree.json` as well.

About 1,500 of the 404s logged during a crawl came from broken links on
Autodesk's own pages, and the target pages already existed under another slug:

- "Derived from:" links that embed the C++ header folder
  (`adsk.core.Materials_Property_id.htm` for `core_Property_id.htm`) are
  rewritten before fetching, and in the stored markdown, so they resolve.
- Core classes linked under a subclass namespace (`fusion_Base.htm`) and sample
  links missing `_Sample` (`MaterialSample.htm`) retry one alternate slug on 404.

### Fixed: a new `corpus build` no longer wipes the previous corpus

A run without `--resume` deleted `corpus.jsonl` and appended to it page by page,
so stopping a re-run early left only the pages fetched so far. `pages/` is now
the source of truth: a fresh run re-fetches and overwrites pages in place, and
`corpus.jsonl` is rebuilt from every page on disk when the run ends, including
on Ctrl-C. A corpus clobbered by the old behaviour is recovered by any run,
since the pages were never deleted. `--resume --limit 1` is the quickest.

### Added: the Claude skill ships from this repo

`SKILL.md` and `install_skill.py` now live here, next to the knowledge markdown
they reference. The skill and the server were maintained as separate copies
before, which meant a gotcha learned in one could sit unwritten in the other.
`install_skill.py --overlay` covers the private-variant case that the fork was
serving.

### Changed: the knowledge base is the full working set

`gotchas.md` and `patterns.md` shipped as a trimmed subset. They are now level
with the working copy: 40 more failure modes and 18 more patterns, so
`find_gotcha` searches 112 sections rather than 72.

### Changed: comments say what the code does, not how it was found

Inline comments across the tool modules carried investigation narrative, dated
verification notes and Fusion build numbers. The facts stay as terse gotcha
flags; the history belongs here.


### Fixed: `doc_state` failed outright on a direct (non-parametric) design

Reported in [#5](https://github.com/Mfrostbutter/fusion-cad-mcp/issues/5). The
generated script read `design.userParameters.count` unconditionally. On a
direct design that raises `RuntimeError: 3 : this is not a parametric design`,
so the whole tool errored out and reported nothing — even though bodies,
sketches, features, components, units, workspace and dirty flag were all
readable. For an agent, the first orienting call against a direct design just
failed.

`doc_state` now reports the mode up front (`design_type`: `"parametric"` or
`"direct"`, plus a boolean `is_parametric`) and reads the parametric-only
fields through a guard that absorbs *only* the "not a parametric design"
`RuntimeError`. Those fields — `parameters_count` and the new `timeline_count`
— come back `null` on a direct design and are listed in a new `unavailable` map
explaining why. Any other error still propagates, so a real failure is never
disguised as a missing field.

The guard is deliberately narrow: on a live direct design the original script
evaluated `root.features.count` successfully and only failed at
`design.userParameters`, so `features_count` is not parametric-only and stays
populated in both modes.

## 0.2.2

### Fixed: a clean install pulled `mcp` 2.x and could not start

Reported in [#2](https://github.com/Mfrostbutter/fusion-cad-mcp/issues/2). The
dependency was declared as `mcp>=1.2.0` with no ceiling. `mcp` 2.0.0 removed
`mcp.server.fastmcp`, which `server.py` imports, so pip resolved to a release
the server cannot run on: the install reported success and every invocation of
the entry point died with `ModuleNotFoundError`. To an MCP client that looks
like a server that will not start, with nothing pointing at the cause.

The requirement is now `mcp>=1.2.0,<2`. Supporting 2.x is a port from
`fastmcp` to `mcpserver` and is not in this release.

### Fixed: `corpus build --resume` scraped nothing and reported success

Reported in [#3](https://github.com/Mfrostbutter/fusion-cad-mcp/issues/3). The
crawl frontier only ever existed in memory, discovered by parsing links out of
pages as they were fetched. `--resume` skipped pages already on disk, so their
links were never extracted, the queue was never repopulated, and an empty queue
read as a finished crawl. A `--limit` smoke test followed by `--resume`, which
is what the `--limit` help text invites, produced a corpus of five pages that
announced `Corpus ready` and exited 0. `find_api` then returned almost nothing,
with no signal pointing back at the build.

Three changes, in the order they take effect:

- **The frontier is persisted.** `frontier.json` holds the pending queue and
  the visited set, written every 250 pages and again on the way out, including
  on Ctrl-C. `--resume` restores it and continues. An interrupted page is
  requeued rather than left marked visited with nothing on disk.
- **A missing frontier is rebuilt from the pages already scraped.** Raw HTML is
  not kept, so the links are re-derived from the converted markdown. This is
  what lets a corpus built by an earlier version resume without re-fetching
  what it already has.
- **A suspicious finish is no longer a success.** A resume that scrapes zero
  pages and recovers no frontier now warns and exits non-zero instead of
  printing `Corpus ready` over a near-empty corpus.

Verified against the live site: a `--limit 5` build followed by `--resume`
restores all 18,223 pending URLs and continues the crawl, and a resume with
`frontier.json` removed rebuilds 18,063 URLs from the pages on disk.

## 0.2.1

### Fixed: `corpus build` was missing from the release entirely

Reported in [#1](https://github.com/Mfrostbutter/fusion-cad-mcp/issues/1). A
`.gitignore` rule meant to keep the built Autodesk corpus out of the repo,
`corpus/`, matched any directory of that name at any depth. It swallowed
`src/fusion_cad_mcp/corpus/`, the builder package itself, so 0.2.0 shipped a
CLI entry point, a README section, and an optional dependency group for code
that was never published. `fusion-cad-mcp corpus build` died on
`ModuleNotFoundError`, and `find_api` had no way to get a corpus.

The ignore rules are now anchored to build output only, and the package is
committed. Three bugs it was hiding are fixed with it:

- `build()` passed `corpus_path=` to a `backfill_metadata.main()` that took no
  arguments, so a completed scrape crashed on the metadata pass.
- `backfill_metadata` read and wrote `corpus.jsonl` beside its own module, not
  the directory the scraper was told to use. Under a normal install that is
  inside site-packages. Both paths now come from the scraper's configured
  output directory.
- The scraper parsed with `lxml`, which was not in the `[corpus]` extra. bs4
  only resolves the parser at first parse, so this surfaced mid-crawl rather
  than at import. `lxml` is now declared, and a missing one falls back to
  `html.parser` instead of failing.

Verified end to end: build, metadata backfill, and a `find_api` query against
the result.

## 0.2.0

First release that works for someone other than its author.

### Fixed: 17 bugs, all verified against live Fusion 2704.1.23

Unit tests can prove generated Python is valid. They cannot prove Fusion accepts
it. A full pass against a live document found 17 bugs that the test suite was
green on, in three classes.

**Generated code was invalid Python (4).** `json.dumps(None)` emits `null`,
which is not a Python name, so the script died inside Fusion with a `NameError`.
`ast.parse` cannot catch this, since `null` is a legal identifier. Hit
`pattern_rectangular` on its default path, `fillet_edges_by_geometry`, and
`set_joint_limits`. Values are now embedded with `repr()`, and a test walks the
AST of every generator's output for JSON literals used as names.

**Calls that could never have worked (9).** Each crashed on first real use
because the Fusion API differs from what the code assumed:

- `bodies_to_components` called `Features.createComponentFromBodyFeatures`,
  which does not exist. Now uses `BRepBody.createComponent()`, and restores the
  body name that Fusion silently resets to `Body1`.
- `set_joint_limits` looked for limits on the `JointMotion`. They live on
  `rotationLimits` / `slideLimits`, and `ValueInput.realValue` raises on string
  input, so expressions are evaluated through `unitsManager`.
- `drive_joint` hit the same `realValue` crash.
- `create_joint` ball motion accepts only pitch=Z, yaw=X out of nine
  principal-axis combinations.
- `create_rigid_group` and `create_contact_set` have no `createInput`, and
  contact sets live on the Design and need assembly-context body proxies.
- `shell` used a `ThicknessDirections` enum that does not exist, and closed
  shells need the body in the input collection.
- `chamfer_edges` and `chamfer_edges_by_geometry` needed the current
  `createInput2()` / `chamferEdgeSets` API.
- `rib` cannot work at all: `RibFeatures` is read-only in this Fusion version.
  It now returns `rib_not_scriptable` with a workaround instead of crashing.

**Silent wrong results (4).** These are the dangerous ones: they returned
`ok: true` while doing the wrong thing, and every check except one passed.

- `pattern_rectangular` produced **three times** the requested geometry. Fusion
  does not treat an unset direction two as a single row. Positions and per-body
  volumes were correct; only the body count was wrong.
- `move_component` reported success without moving, twice over: the timeline
  roll reverted the transform, and `snapshots.add()` snapped ground-to-parent
  occurrences back.
- `drive_joint` reported success when Fusion silently ignored a drive past a
  joint limit. It now reports `applied`.
- `add_hole` always drilled the tallest `+Z` face, so a hole aimed at a lower
  step started in mid-air. It now prefers the face containing the target XY.

`rebuild_feature` also had its destructive window narrowed: a sketch with zero
profiles now fails preflight instead of after the delete, and a profile getter
that raises on a stale feature is caught rather than crashing mid-repair.

### Added

- **`tools.md`**, a full reference for all 75 tools: signatures, exact enums,
  return keys, error codes, and per-tool traps.
- **`find_tool`**, searching that reference, so a client can look up a signature
  on demand instead of carrying 56 KB in context.
- **14 gotcha entries** from the live testing, written as reusable Fusion API
  knowledge rather than release notes.
- **`fusion-cad-mcp corpus build`**, the subcommand `find_api`'s error message
  had been promising without it existing. Behind an explicit Autodesk terms
  gate; the corpus is still never redistributed.
- **A `[corpus]` extra** for the scraper's dependencies, likewise documented but
  previously absent.

### Changed

- Knowledge markdown now ships inside the wheel, so `find_tool`, `find_gotcha`
  and `find_pattern` work on a plain `pip install`. Previously they only worked
  from a repo checkout. A test fails if the packaged copies drift from source.
- The adapter re-handshakes when Fusion rejects a stale session. It had claimed
  to do this in its docstring and did not, so a Fusion restart meant restarting
  the MCP server.
- Knowledge search ranks by term rarity and query coverage, with log-damped
  occurrence counts. Searching `"pattern_rectangular direction two"` used to
  return the `shell` section first.
- Status moved from alpha to beta. 467 tests.

### Known limitations

- `rib` is permanently unavailable pending a Fusion API change.
- `add_hole` only drills `+Z`-facing faces, so it cannot place a hole on a
  rotated body.
- Most sketch tools resolve sketches in the root component only.
- Edge filters measure chord distance, not arc length, so circular edges
  measure zero.
- `find_api` needs a user-built corpus.

## 0.1.0

Initial scaffold: adapter, envelope, entity handles, and the first tool groups.
